# jetConfig
Jetbrains cross-IDE configuration files.

## Hybrid Approach
jetConfig was designed to mostly replace JetBrains settings sync. However, some things are done better by the inbuilt sync utility.

Here's what I have enabled and disabled in the IDE under `Backup & Sync` > `Settings to sync`:
- [ ] UI Settings
- [ ] Keymaps
- [ ] Code settings
- [X] Plugins (manully deselected the ones that are for a different IDE)
- [x] Tools
- [ ] System settings

across ALL JetBrains IDE products.
